# On-the-hardness-of-approximation


In general, solving an optimization problem is very hard. However it is never well explained why these types of problems are difficult to solve from a computational complexity and thoeretical computer science point of view.

In this project, I presented a lecture in which I explained the hardness of approximation using Probabilistic Turing Machines. Specifically I coverd the topic of PCP theorem, a strong result in compelxity theory, that linked NP class with a special complexity class called PCP.

In presentation.pdf you can see the slide of the presentation.
