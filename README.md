# On-the-hardness-of-approximation


In general, solving an optimization problem is very hard. However it is never well explained why these types of problems are difficult to solve from a computational complexity and theoretical computer science point of view.

In this project, I presented a lecture in which I explained the hardness of approximation using Probabilistic Turing Machines. Specifically I coverd the topic of PCP theorem, a strong result in complexity theory, that links NP class complexity with a special complexity class called PCP.

PCP thorem implies a lot of consequences in several fields of mathematics and discrete optimization.

In [presentation.pdf](https://github.com/senad96/On-the-hardness-of-approximation/blob/main/presentation.pdf) you can see the slide of the presentation.
